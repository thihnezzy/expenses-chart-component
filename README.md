- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars

## My process

### Built with

- Pure HTML/CSS
- Javascript
- Deploy with Vercel
### What I learned

- Using Async/Await function
- Get familiar with EventListener
- Improve HTML/CSS coding time


### Continued development

In this exercise/project, I didn't finish the responsive for mobile. I want to focus on desktop-first and master it. After that, I will continue to code for mobile design.


### Useful resources

- [Learn Async/Await](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J29jeuyMJ38&t=1054s&ab_channel=ThuNghiem) - This helped me have a better view of using Async/Await to get data from data.json
